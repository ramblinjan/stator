WIP.

Coming soon: a highly capable state-based routing library that simply treats
the URI as an interface to application state, represented by a single object.

Inspired by [can-route](https://canjs.com/doc/can-route.html).

## Design goals

  * The death of "declarative routing"
  * One-time route configuration at the entry point of an application
  * Simple-by-default integration for major frameworks
  * Eventually, integration with observable libaries such as RxJS
  * Eventually eventually, first-class integration with Redux

## Design anti-goals

  * Documentation that uses the word "just" or "simply"
  * "Blazing fast"
  * Literally any feature that encourages route definitions to happen all over an application
